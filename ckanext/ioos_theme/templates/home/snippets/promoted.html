      <p>The IOOS Catalog (<a href="https://data.ioos.us/">https://data.ioos.us/</a>) is an open data portal. This implementation, based on the IOOS Catalog is intended for collecting and managing data held by Romanian public authorities and research institutions and it is realized in the frame of the project <em>SPERO &#8211; Space technologies used in the management of disasters and major crises, manifested at local, national and regional levels</em>. SPERO received funding from the Minister of Research and Innovation, <a href="https://uefiscdi.ro">UEFISCDI</a> under grant agreement no 3Sol/2017, Programme PNCDI III, duration: April 2017 &#8211; March 2020. The beneficiary public authority of this project is &#8220;Romanian Space Agency&#8221; (<a href="http://rosa.ro">ROSA</a>).</p>

The Catalog inventories all the compliant data access service endpoints provided by the interested Organizations in a single
    metadata repository, for discovery by end users.  </p>

<p>The Catalog is populated by ISO 19115 and INSPIRE compatible metadata records using standard vocabularies and data formats (netCDF-CF, ACDD) wherever
    possible.  Organizations publish their metadata to web accessible folders, or
    OGC CS-W services, and the Catalog harvests metadata from these locations on a daily basis.  </p>

<p>The Catalog provides a searchable graphical user interface (<a href="http://ckan.apps.spero.ici.ro">http://ckan.apps.spero.ici.ro</a>)
    for interactive data discovery by users</p>
